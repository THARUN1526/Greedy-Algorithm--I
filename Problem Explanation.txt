This problem involves transferring a string through a network using a special protocol. The protocol allows two types of operations:

1. Transfer 1 copy of a lowercase English alphabet character through the network.
2. Transfer 2 copies of a lowercase English alphabet character through the network.

The goal is to find the minimum time required to transfer the entire given string through the network.

Here's an explanation of the input format:

- The first line of input contains an integer T, representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, there are two lines of input:
  - The first line contains an integer N, representing the length of the string S.
  - The second line contains the string S.

The output format should consist of T lines, each representing the minimum time required for a test case.

Constraints:
- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100: The number of test cases.
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 105: The length of the string S.
- The sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 105.
- The string S contains lowercase English alphabet characters only.

Example:

Input:
2
5
cbcdc
6
aabeee

Output:
5
4

Explanation:
For the first test case, the string "cbcdc" can be transferred as follows:
- Transfer 'c' once.
- Transfer 'b' once.
- Transfer 'c' twice.
- Transfer 'd' once.

Total time = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5

For the second test case, the string "aabeee" can be transferred as follows:
- Transfer 'a' twice.
- Transfer 'b' once.
- Transfer 'e' once.
- Transfer 'e' once.

Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4

The goal is to find the minimum time required to transfer the entire string by choosing the optimal number of copies to transfer for each character.
